READ ME BIOINFO

This program takes two arguments.  The 1st one must be a number (int format).
the second must be a .txt file located in the same folder as the program.

This program has five .java files.  They are: 
Sequences.java, Bioinfo.java, SLList.java, List.java and Node.java

I decided to design the program one method at a time.  When one method was working properly
I would start on the next method.  

The biggest issue I had with this project was making sure I didnt miss anything.
Being such a long project and having over 600 lines of code made me worry that I would miss
a special case or code a method incorrectly.  I tried very hard to break my code as much as possible 
to avoid missing anything.

I am most proud of my overlap method.  I think I coded it very well and was cleaver with the use
of my min value to find the overlap.
